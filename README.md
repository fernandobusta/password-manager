# Password Manager
This Password Manager securely encrypts and stores user passwords using a hashing mechanism.

## Key Features:

- Hash Mapping:
  Utilizes dictionaries to map all characters to their corresponding hash values, ensuring that passwords are encrypted effectively.

- Secure Storage:
  All passwords are saved securely and can only be accessed by users who have the appropriate access to the hashes.

- User Authentication:
  Implements a user authentication system requiring users to enter a password to access the application, adding an extra layer of security.

This project demonstrates an effective approach to password management, focusing on security and user accessibility.
